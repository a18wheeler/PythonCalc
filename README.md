## Python Calculator

This is a small project that I am doing in order to understand Python and create a project that can be displayed.

The example code here has been grabbed from [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-mvqlkHOHY). Since the guy didn't really explain his code, I will have to look through it an look each part up in order to understand it.

My goal here is to understand the code and then improve upon the previous code. Whether that be by adding functions or changing the design.
